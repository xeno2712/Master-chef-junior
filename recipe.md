Boiling Pasta - More often than not, we dunk the pasta in water at room temperature and then put it on boil which is the worst way to cook pasta. Instead, take some water and bring it to boil. Then add a tablespoon of salt and some olive oil. Now, put in the pasta and let it boil till the pasta is translucent. Make sure there's enough water in the pot so that the pasta doesn't stick.2. Tomatoes for the Sauce - If you're making your own tomato sauce from scratch then first dip the tomatoes in boiling water till they become soft enough for you to peel off the skin. Then, carefully remove the pulp and mash the tomatoes, with your hands preferably.3. Cheese - Personally, I've always loved me some Parmesan which I shave over the pasta towards the end but if you want yours to cook in cheese then I'd recommend a bit of cheddar mixed with parmesan.4. Herbs & Seasoning - A pinch of chilli flakes, oregano and basil can give your pasta a delicious kick.5. Garnish - It's all about piling on and you can do so with great finesse with the right kind of ingredients. Nuts like pine nuts, walnuts, almonds or herbs, lemon zest, cheese shavings and many types of meat like crispy bacon bits, diced sausages, small cubes of ham and more.
